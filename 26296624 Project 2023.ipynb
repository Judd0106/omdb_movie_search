    "### What is a Rest API and how does the interaction take place?\n",
    "\n",
    "A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that help different computer systems talk to each other on the internet. It assists in sharing information in a standardized way. This is used to create websites and apps that can work together and share information with each other.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In a REST API, resources are identified by unique URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) and can be manipulated using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. The API then returns data in a specific format such as JSON or XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "OMDB (Open Movie Database) is a RESTful API that provides a database of movies and TV shows along with information such as ratings, reviews, plot summaries, and more. To interact with the OMDB API using Python, PyPI (Python Package Index) can be used which a useful wrapper for accessing the API, which allows easier access on information about movies and TV shows. Using a package like omdb can save developers time and effort by handling the details of making HTTP requests and parsing the responses, allowing them to focus on using the data returned by the API in their Python code."

    "### Intouction to the program:\n",
    "This program allows you to search for movies or TV series using the OMDB(Open Movie Database) API. You can search by movie/series title. TV series with season and episode details, or by IMDB ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key design decisions in this program:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. OMDB Module: The program makes use of the omdb module, which offers a straightforward interface for gaining access to the OMDB API. This module enables HTTP queries to the OMDB API endpoints for the retrieval of movie and TV series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Movie_Search Class:  Serves as the key component for searching  movies or TV shows . It has tools for searching by IMDB ID, title, series, season, or episode. In order to show the user the data that was retrieved, it also contains a display function to present the user with the particular information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Movie_History Class: This class is in charge of handling user search history. It has features for saving searched TV series or movies to a file as well as reading the search history from that file. The search history is displayed to the user upon request.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Main Programme Loop: The user can choose the desired search option from a menu presented to them by the main programme loop. The appropriate methods from the Movie_Search and Movie_History classes are then called using the user's selection. The user's search history is updated while the search results are shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Basic input validation is carried out by the programme to make sure that the user enters valid data. For instance, the programme displays the proper error message if an invalid title, season, episode, or IMDB ID is entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. User-Friendly Output: By structuring the acquired movie or TV series data, the programme produces user-friendly output. Title, year, rating, runtime, genre, director, plot, language, country, awards, poster, ratings, IMDB rating, IMDB votes, and IMDB ID are just a few of the information that is displayed. To improve the user's experience, the information is presented in a clear manner.\n",

    "### An Overview of how data was collected for the program:\n",
    "\n",
    "The OMDB (Open Movie Database) API was utilized for the necessary data in this program. As mentioned prior the OMDB API serves as an avenue for obtaining movie and TV series data. With a structure that remains RESTful, the OMDB API supplies an expansive repository of movie and TV series information. This web service's endpoints can be utilized to access exact information about episodes, seasons, movies, TV series, and other related data\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to interact with the OMDB API, the omdb module—which serves as a wrapper—was imported. This module facilitates the handling of HTTP requests to the OMDB API and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the omdb module, I managed to obtain data via a range of methods. One of these involved utilizing the omdb.title() method to locate TV shows or movies by their titles. Once I fed the method with the relevant title, it promptly queried the OMDB API and returned the resulting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the omdb.get() method, I retrieved information about TV shows via parameters like name, season, and episode. By providing the title of the series, its episode number and season, the method was able to fetch the relevant data from the OMDB API.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing the omdb.imdbid() method, I managed to locate films or television programs by their IMDB IDs and consequently extract relevant information. Using the IMDB ID as the method's input parameter facilitated the direct retrieval of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the OMDB API's dataset, discover the cast, awards, director, plot, poster, rating, release year, and other assorted details about movies and television programs.\n",
    "\n"

    "### Retrospective:\n",
    "\n",
    "I faced a few obstacles while creating this program, Understanding the OMDB API's usage and structure proved to be one of the early challenges. To understand the available endpoints, parameters, and response formats, I had to carefully read the API documentation. To correctly query the API for various types of searches, some trial and error was necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also made use of Object Orientated Programming, which required research and understanding of how objects could be created in relation to the OMDB API and its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge was handling invalid or incorrect user inputs. I implemented conditional checks to validate the user's input for movie titles, series titles, season numbers, episode numbers, and IMDB IDs. If the input was invalid, appropriate error messages were displayed to guide the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I faced a challenge in formatting and displaying the retrieved data from the API in a user-friendly manner. I developed the display() and display_season() methods to extract the required information from the API response and present it in a readable format. This required accessing nested dictionaries and lists within the API response in order to extract the necessary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following areas, the program could be strengthened:\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling: The program handles input errors in a basic way, but it could be improved to show more thorough error messages. Then, users could fix their mistakes and learn from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more user-friendly user interface would improve the program's usability. Users would be guided in providing the necessary inputs and understanding the available options if prompts and instructions were added throughout the program. In order to improve the user experience, I would also take into account a graphical user interface (GUI).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is currently only a small amount of exception handling in the program. More robust exception handling should be put in place to deal with potential errors like problems with network connectivity or incorrect OMDB API responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned a great deal a about working with APIs, handling API responses, and creating a command-line interface for user interaction while creating this program. Additionally, I gained a better understanding of Python's handling of files, HTTP requests, responses, and errors.\n",
